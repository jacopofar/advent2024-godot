### Advent of Code 2024 in Godot

Pretty much what the title says.

Running the project requires Godot 4.4 (prsumably will work also on later version with minimal or no changes).

Executing it shows a window with an input for the problem and a button to run it, plus a selctor for th day.

Sometimes a visualization is shown.

## Current status

* Day 01 - 07 done
* For day 06 there's a visualization of the guard path and potential loops
